# pythonProject
Used yolov3 and opencv to detect objects

This is a practice project which I did by following "Murtaza's workshop" from youtube! The youtube tutorial was excellent! Therefore, there might be similarity between the codes 
performed in Murtaza's workshop and mine. But I tried to write every line of code understanding it and I explained the code using comments!

To perform the tasks you need to download the weights and configuration files and add them into pycharm/colab any platform you use. The link to download the weights and
configuration files is given below :
